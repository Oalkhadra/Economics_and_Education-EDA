Python 3.9.7 was used for this project. 
All of the requirements for this project are imports which can be found within the notebook files themselves.

This project contains three Jupyter notebooks: get_clean_data, run_analysis, and visualize_results.

To replicate the results of this project, files must be executed chronologically, in the order they are mentioned above. This project makes use of a csv file located in the data/raw folder, and two Wikipedia pages. The links for those pages can be found within the get_clean_data.py.

Firstly, running the get_clean_data.ipynb will download, clean, and wrangle the datasets. The file will also save the processed datasets in the data/processed folder.
Secondly, run_analysis.ipynb is run to explore the data through statistical analyses. 
Thirdly, visualize_results.ipynb is run to create visualizations of the data.

A full report detailing the basis of this project, the data collection process, the analysis/results/visualizations, and proposals for future work can be found in the results folder.

It is important to note that the animation in Figure 4 of the report does not run on PDF or the notebook. The file for this animation can be found in the results folder under "Time.gif".
